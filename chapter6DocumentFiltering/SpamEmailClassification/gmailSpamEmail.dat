************************************************************************

Just how powerful is Windows=C2=AE 8?

In large-scale individual tests, TuneUp=E2=80=99s experts took an in-depth =
look
at the strengths and weaknesses of Windows=C2=AE 8 compared to the previous
version and summarized our results below:

[+] 50% Faster Startup Time!
On an ultrabook with a Core i7 processor and SSD, Windows=C2=AE 8 started u=
p
in just 11 seconds. Windows=C2=AE 7 on the other hand, needed almost twice =
as
long. An older desktop PC with a Core 2 Duo processor and conventional
HDD started up in a mere 33 seconds on Windows=C2=AE 8, compared to 62
seconds before!

[+] Increased Speed!
Daily performance was measured using the highly respected tool PC Mark=C2=
=AE 7.=20
It tested the automatic conversion of videos, gaming performance, the
ability to process thousands of Word operations and also simulated
virus scans. The results showed a clear difference between the
performance of Windows=C2=AE 7 and the new Windows=C2=AE 8.

On a Samsung tablet with a Core i5 processor and SSD, Windows=C2=AE 8
achieved a total score of 1351 points, compared to the 1221 reached by
Windows=C2=AE 7.

************************************************************************

Windows=C2=AE 8 Optimization Potential with TuneUp Utilities=E2=84=A2 2013

Following up on the impressive results from our initial tests, we
checked how the performance of Windows=C2=AE 8 changed after two months and
after 150 popular programs had been installed.  Does using TuneUp
Utilities=E2=84=A2 2013 to optimize a Windows=C2=AE 8 system still make any=
 sense? We
put this to the test on a  three-year-old notebook (Core 2 Duo 3 GHz, 4 GB=
=20
RAM, 256 GB SSD).

[-] Rapid Memory Consumption
The less memory available, the slower programs tend to run. This fact
also applies, unfortunately, to Windows=C2=AE 8, as our testing  proved.
After installing the new programs, memory usage ballooned from an
initial 1.4 GB to a whopping 2.6 GB. The many new services, startup
programs, and background processes created a significant load on system
memory.


Ram usage

Clean install: 1413 MB
150 programs installed: 2611 MB
Optimized with TuneUp: 1001 MB


[+] TuneUp Utilities=E2=84=A2 2013: After using TuneUp Program Deactivator=
=E2=84=A2,
Turbo Mode, StartUp Manager, and many other tools to optimize the PC, it
ran even better than a new one: Windows=C2=AE 8 took up only around 1 GB on
the system.

[-] Slowdown  Due to Software Bloat
With of 150 programs installed, it took 170 seconds to complete startup.
What's more, performance in the PC Mark=C2=AE 7 test fell by almost 50% to =
a
mere 1151 points.


Boot time to Windows=C2=AE 8 Start screen

Clean install: 61 seconds
150 programs installed: 170 seconds
Optimized with TuneUp: 55 seconds


[+] TuneUp Utilities=E2=84=A2 2013: Our tuning software not only restored t=
he
startup and operating speed of Windows=C2=AE 8, even when loaded down by 15=
0
programs, it actually improved the score. Innovative tools, such as
TuneUp Program Deactivator=E2=84=A2 and  Live Optimization 2.0, keep your P=
C in
top shape like never before.
